##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design and deploy a comprehensive **Ridership Dashboard** for IndyGo as a foundational component of a broader open data platform initiative.

Public transit agencies like IndyGo are under increasing pressure to operate transparently, make data-informed decisions, and respond to community needs. Although operational data is collected, it is often underutilized or inaccessible.

This dashboard aims to:

- Centralize and visualize **stop-level ridership data** across key dimensions: time, route, geography, and service type.
- Provide **IndyGo planners, analysts, and city officials** with actionable insights to improve route planning, service frequency, and resource allocation.
- **Engage the public** and increase transparency by making data trends accessible and easy to interpret.

##  Dashboard Highlights

- **Total Ridership** by workday type, year, month, and route
- **Stop-wise and Route-wise comparisons**
- **Time-based trends** (week number, day of week, monthly patterns)
- **Interactive map visualizations** with drill-down filtering
